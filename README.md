My first GitHub Repository 
My name is Anthony Henderson, I am a 29 year old student at The University of St. Andrews studying International Relations with Social Anthropology, though looking to change to a computer sciences course as that's where my interests lie. It seems like an enormous ocean of necessity and could do with guidance as to where to begin, an as such have found myself grazing on lots of different languages and web based technologies rather than focus ins soley on a particular area.
